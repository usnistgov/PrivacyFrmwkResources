**Crosswalk Name:** NIST Privacy Framework 1.0-Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 Crosswalk

**Source Type:** laws and regulations

**Contributor Notes:** 
•	Mapped elements represent where the DPDPA requires a control that would fall under the NIST Core subcategory or a control under the NIST Core subcategory would support activities under the DPDPA.
•	To make it easier for readers, the DPDPA legislation has been broken down chapter wise. Sections and Subsections have been mapped against relevant sections of the NIST Privacy Framework V1.0 in the NIST Privacy V1.0 Core to DPDPA worksheet.
•	Quick Reference worksheet has the DPDPA sections mapped to actual citation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023 as well as mapping to the relevant sections of the EU GDPR to provide better context.
•	Readers will also notice that many of the Privacy Framework’s subcategories do not map neatly to the DPDPA. The DPDPA is an “umbrella” legislation, as it sets out only a high-level framework for India’s new data protection regime, with supplementary rules expected in due course. 

**Methodology **
•	The NIST Privacy Framework was retrieved from the https://www.nist.gov/document/nist-privacy-framework-v10-core and the DPDPA ACT was retrieved from MEITY https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023.pdf 
•	Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool CPRT has been leveraged for manually mapping to the DPDPA Act 2023.

**Reasoning behind the mapping**  
Readers should note that the DPDPA does share common objectives of protecting individuals' privacy rights and regulating the processing of personal data with other privacy regulations such as CCPA or GDPR; however, each are shaped by distinct legal, cultural, and regulatory contexts. This leads to differences in scope, implementation, and enforcement mechanisms. 
For Example: 

•	Chapter I – Preliminary of the bill focuses largely on definitions such as “Data Fiduciary”, “Data Principal”, etc which have been mapped to IDENTIFY-P (ID-P) and GOVERN-P (GV-P) as the definitions outline the scope of the Bill with respect to your organization. For example, the DPDPA Data Principal definition has parlance to GDPR Data Subject definition, however the DPDPA introduces child and guardian concept in the data principal description itself rather than defining the consent in a separate Art. 8: Child's consent or Art. 9: Processing special categories of data in the GDPR.

•	Chapter II - Obligations of Data Fiduciary has parlance to Technical and Organizational controls mandated in other global legislations which have been mapped largely to CONTROL-P (CT-P) and PROTECT-P (PR-P) in addition to other NIST Core subcategory. What sets DPDPA distinct from other regulations is the concept of “Consent Manager”. A "consent manager" within the context of the DPDPA refers to a mechanism or tool that enables Data Principals to exercise control over the processing of their personal data by providing informed and specific consent which can be then leveraged by the Data Fiduciary for processing. While specific details about the implementation of a consent manager under the DPDPA in India are yet to be finalized, it's likely that such a mechanism will play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with data protection requirements and empowering individuals to exercise control over their personal data. The ownership, accountability and responsibility are placed on the Data Fiduciary to ensure the these controls are implemented across the lifecycle of the processing irrespective if it is done by the Data Fiduciary itself or outsourced to third parties/processors and sub processors. 

**Historical Context**
•	Prior to the DPDPA, India’s data protection rules are made up of Section 43A and 87(2)(ob) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011.
•	In a historic decision delivered on 24th August 2017, the Indian Supreme Court bench unanimously recognised the fundamental right to privacy of every individual as guaranteed by the Constitution, within Article 21 in particular and Part III on the whole. 
•	The ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) constituted A 10-member panel headed by retired Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna in August 2017 to arrive at a data protection bill. https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf
•	The first draft of the Data Protection Bill came out in 2018. After various rounds of amendment in 2019 and 2021, the bill was scrapped and replaced with the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022.
•	On 18 November 2022, MEITY released the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022 for public consultation.
•	The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was passed by Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian Parliament) on August 7, 2023, and by the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian Parliament) on August 9, 2023. The DPDPA received the President’s assent and was enacted into law on August 11, 2023. Factors such as accountability, transparency, data minimisation, fairness, accuracy, and lawful processing of personal data have been reflected in the DPDPA. It addresses Data Principals as ‘she/her,’ which is unseen in any Indian law till date and sets the tone in a new light.
•	The DPDPA is “umbrella” legislation, as it sets out only a high-level framework for India’s new data protection regime, with supplementary rules expected in due course.
