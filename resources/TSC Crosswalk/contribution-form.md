**Contributor Notes:** The purpose of mapping the NIST Privacy Framework to the 2017 Trust Services Criteria   (inclusive of March 2020 updates) is to support SOC compliance efforts for organizations aligned with the NIST Privacy Framework. 
This mapping may be leveraged by privacy and GRC teams to perform a SOC readiness assessment and by service auditors to evaluate whether the NIST Privacy Framework may be considered suitable criteria in an attestation examination.

Sincere thanks to Dylan Gilbert, Privacy Policy Advisor at NIST, and Jason Cronk, author of Strategic Privacy by Design for their feedback.
